# Metryka-Marczewskiego-Steinhausa
The task concerns the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric. The program is to calculate the distance matrix between collections, finding the most distant pairs of collections that have the same content. To calculate the distance, we use a fraction whose denominator is the total sum of the sets and the numerator is the difference of these sets.
